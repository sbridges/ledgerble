;Let's buy some shares

#You can either declare the price of a share 
#like this

P 2018/01/02 15:50:00 APPL $2300

#And you can buy a share like this

2018/01/05
    Assets:Shares  5 APPL@$2000
    Assets:Savings

#Shares can be purchased at different prices.
#(Also, another way to specify purchase price)

2018/01/06
    Assets:Shares  5 APPL
    Assets:Savings  -$3000

#But the report will be based on the latest 
#available price of the share, which in this case 
#is the price of the purchase above. The right 
#amount (the purchased price) is dedcuted from
#the account where payment for the purchase is made.

;When you use savings to buy a share, you can see
;your Ca - De go down on the report üëâ
;Ca - De denotes Cash - Debt 
;As shares are not considered cash, your total 
;Ca - De will decrease naturally
;This simply means you have less liquid cash 
;now. Shares, although quite liquid, is riskier 
;than cash in most situation. If you have a 
;mortgage at a certain amount, you can be sure that
;a certain amount of cash can be used to pay back
;the debt provided that the currency of cash is 
;similar to the currency of the debt. You cannot 
;be sure of the price of shares as it is in a 
;different denomination than the mortgage.

#Ah, speaking of mortgage, I shouldn't forget 
#that amount I owe to the bank

2018/01/01
    Liabilities:Mortgage  -$28000
    Equity:Opening

;You may had noticed by now that I am using an 
;earlier date in this transaction. The order of
;the date doesn't matter in this journal. 

#You can use any kind of sub-accounts you 
#want but these root accounts matters:
#
#Assets
#Assets:Savings
#Assets:Current
#Liabilities
#Equity
#Income
#Expenses

#These are the basis of how Prudent produces 
#the report
